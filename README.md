1 Thing Against Racism is a grassroot movement to encourage everybody to make a small but meaningful contribution to fight racism, to inspire more people to join the force, and each and every contribution together can make a much bigger impact.

Even though the anti-Asian hate is not under the spotlight in today’s news, the issue still exists. The AAPI community and our allies could sit still doing nothing today, waiting until another horrible incident will inevitably happen again. Or we could continue the momentum that we all built together in the past few months. We shall continue contributing to the cause, one small thing at a time. Together, we can eventually gain the racial equality we deserve.
